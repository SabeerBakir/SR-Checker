# SR-Checker
Small Program to check SR on Overwatch
by @Wackobako_OW

DM me the bugs on Twitter (@Wackobako_OW) or Discord Wackobako#2740

- For the file option, It should be text file with each battletag on a newline and no spaces
  Example:

...

DPSMercy#21269

wackobako#2709

HotChocolate#21149

Marshmallows#21264

WhippedCream#21180

...
  
  
  The file should be in the same folder as the program, or you can put the file path instead.
